<h3>Conclusions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Swimmers tend to have lower weights compared to volleyball players, which might be due to the nature of their sport requiring a leaner physique.</li>
  <li>Volleyball players generally have taller heights than swimmers, possibly because height can be an advantage in volleyball for reaching and blocking.</li>
  <li>Swimmers typically spend more hours per week on training compared to volleyball players, indicating the intensive nature of swimming training.</li>
</ul>
